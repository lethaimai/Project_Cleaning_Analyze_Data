# Project_Cleaning_Analyze_Data
# 1. Introduction In this guided project, we'll work with exit surveys from employees of the [Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Education_(Queensland) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. We've made some slight modifications to these datasets to make them easier to work with, including changing the encoding to UTF-8 (the original ones are encoded using cp1252).  In this project, we'll play the role of data analyst and pretend our stakeholders want to know the following:  * Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?   * Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?   They want us to combine the results for both surveys to answer these questions. However, although both used the same survey template, one of them customized some of the answers. In the guided steps, we'll aim to do most of the data cleaning and get you started analyzing the first question.
